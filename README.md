## Coding task brief

- **Using the public [API documentation](http://demo.infiny.cloud/api-documentation) connect to the Infiny API and display a list of “CloudLX” services in an account. It should be possible to navigate through to a new page/view showing the details of the service, to include service name, port name, service status and any other details returned by the API that you think are useful.**
- **The code should be written to a high standard of modern PHP. You can optionally use any framework/packages you wish.**
- **The code should be publicly available online, so we can review it after you have created it. You can choose to do this in any way you see fit.**
- **You can use any method you like to connect to the API. However, the method and approach chosen is core to what we will be reviewing.**
- **The finished code should be able to be downloaded and run in a standard LAMP stack.**
